# scurve

A 2D survival game written in Lua on the LÖVE framework

# Installation

Playing games using LÖVE is explained on the [LÖVE wiki](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started). You can either:

1. Download the framework itself from the wiki. LÖVE will appear as an application bundle or .exe file on your computer. Drag the scurve folder on to your LÖVE application bundle (Mac OS X), `love.exe` file (Windows), or use the command line (Linux): `love /home/path/to/gamedir/`, or
2. Download the framework and game packaged together as a Mac OS X application [here](https://github.com/nduckwiler/app-bundles/blob/master/scurve.zip) or a Windows executable [here](https://github.com/nduckwiler/app-bundles/blob/master/scurve-windows.zip). If you get any warning messages when you try to run the OS X application, hold the control key and click the app icon in the Finder. Click Open.
